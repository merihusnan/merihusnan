what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas or solutions. It is often used in a group setting, but can also be done alone. Brainstorming involves generating a list of ideas and then evaluating them to see which are the best.
There are a few different techniques that can be used when brainstorming. One is called free association, which is when you come up with ideas without censoring yourself. This can help you to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Another technique is called mind mapping, which is when you create a visual representation of your thoughts. This can help you to see the connections between different ideas and to better organize your thoughts.

Brainstorming can be a helpful way to generate new ideas or solutions to problems.

Invention ideas can be anything from a new way to make a product or service more efficient, to a better way to store food. Sometimes, the best ideas come from scratch – when an inventor has a great idea for something that nobody else has thought of. For example, in the medical world, many people are still surprised by how often diseases sneak up on people unawares. A doctor might come up with a new treatment for cancer that nobody else knew about.
