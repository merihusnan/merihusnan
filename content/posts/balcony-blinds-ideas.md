what is creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that is open to interpretation. It can be anything from painting and sculpture, to music and dance. Creative art is about expressing yourself and your ideas, in a way that is unique to you.
There are no rules or guidelines to creative art, which is what makes it so special. It is a way for you to express yourself freely, without having to conform to anyone else’s standards.

Creative art can be a great outlet for emotions and feelings that you may not be able to express in words. It can be therapeutic, and help you to connect with your inner thoughts and feelings.
