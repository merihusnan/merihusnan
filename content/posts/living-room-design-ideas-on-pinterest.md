For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.

The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

Thesis: There are a lot of new ideas out there, but what are the best ones?
The best new ideas come from a variety of sources, but some of the most promising concepts come from the fields of neuroscience and computer science. These two fields are providing researchers with innovative ways to study the human brain and provide insights into how we process information. In neuroscience, researchers are currently working on understanding how the brain functions and how it is changed by experience. This research could lead to new treatments for mental health problems and possible cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease. Meanwhile, in computer science, researchers are working on developing advanced virtual reality headsets and other gaming platforms that could revolutionize how people learn new skills. By understanding these two branches of research, scientists can develop better ideas for products and services that would be more effective or fun for users.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.
