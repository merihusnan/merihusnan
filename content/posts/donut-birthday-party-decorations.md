Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!

Invention: What are the four ways that invention happens?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not currently existing. Invention occurs in many different ways, but four are particularly important: Creative Art, Technology, Business and Science. 
Creative Art occurs when people come up with new ideas or designs that they never would have thought of before. This can be done through brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, or even just looking at something and thinking of potential solutions. Technology happens when scientists find new ways to make things work better and faster. Business happens when companies decide how to use their invention and create products that people will want to buy. Science happens when scientists figure out how things work and learn how to make them work better.

Patenting: How do inventions work?
Patenting is the process of claiming a new invention as your own. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can take anywhere from one to six months to be granted. Once granted, your invention can be used to protect it from others who may want to make a similar product or service.
