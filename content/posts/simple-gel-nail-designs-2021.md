Trends in mobility: How is mobile technology affecting business and how will it impact the future of work?
Mobile technology is slowly but surely affecting business as more and more people move around the world. This has a big impact on the future of work, as businesses have to adapt to the needs of their customers who are increasingly using mobile devices for work purposes. Here are some ideas for how mobile technology will affect business in 2022:
1) The rise in mobile phone ownership: In 2020, over 50% of Australians had a mobile phone, up from just 25% in 2009. This has led to a big increase in the demand for data and voice services. As people becomemore reliant on their phones for work purposes, companies need to be prepared to offer good deals on data and voice rates.

2) The shift towards digital working: Technology has been gradually getting better at letting people collaborate through electronic means.

what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.
