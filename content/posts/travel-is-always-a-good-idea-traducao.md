Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones. This increased efficiency can lead to improved quality of life for individuals and societies as a whole.

Regionalism: How does regionality play into the definition and appreciation of art?
Regionality has long been a defining factor for appreciation of art. The idea that art should be appreciated in its entirety, not just within a certain area, is something that has been debated by artists and critics alike. Regionalism can play a role in this debate by providing an understanding of the artist's perspective. Regionalism also allows us to better appreciate different artistic styles and movements.
