A definition of big idea: What is it, and how do we define it?
Big ideas are typically things that have the potential to change the world. They are big, ambitious, and novel, and they typically require a lot of effort and thought to put into them. There is no one right way to define big ideas, but some common definitions include: 
1. A big idea is an important concept or proposition that has the potential to make a real impact in people's lives
2. A big idea is something that is new and exciting, and it could change the way people think or feel about something
3. A big idea can be a goal or aspiration for someone, or it could be a new way of looking at things that could have significant consequences
4. A big idea can be an inspiration for creative work, or it can be a resource for learning about new topics

The future of work: what will be needed for a Robots Apocalypse?
Work is currently the foundation of society. It allows people to earn a living and provide for their families. However, as technology continues to advance, it is clear that work will need to change in order to accommodate the needs of an all-out robotic apocalypse. Some key ideas that could be implemented in order to make work more efficient and affordable include robotically joining factories as production lines, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in order to automate tasks, and implementing robots into service industries such as healthcare or manufacturing. With so much at stake for the future of work, it is important to consider what needs to be done in order to make this type of change a reality.
