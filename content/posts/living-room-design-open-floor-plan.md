Section 4: How to overcome creative blocks.
Nearly everyone experiences creative blocks at some point in their lives. For some people, it happens frequently; for others, more rarely. But whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to dabble in creativity from time to time, it can be frustrating when you suddenly find yourself unable to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways you can overcome creative blocks. One is to simply take a break from whatever project you’re working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is a little distance to see things in a new light and come up with the solutions you couldn’t see before.

Another way to overcome creative blocks is to brainstorm with someone else. Collaborating with someone can help spark new ideas and give you perspective on problems you’re having trouble solving on your own.

History of inventions: How have inventions been made over time?
Inventions have been made for centuries, but it is only recently that there has been a concerted effort to collect and study these inventions. Many of the most amazing and influential inventions have come about through collaboration between multiple individuals or teams. Here are four examples of how inventions have been made over time:

1) The telephone – This invention was first developed in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and his partner Samuel Morse. They designed a talking telephone which could be used to communicate with one another.

2) The electric light bulb – This invention was first developed in 1879 by George Stephenson and John Wise. They created a device that could be plugged into an electrical outlet and use electricity to produce light.

3) The air-purifier – This invention was first developed in 1919 by Maynard Kelleher and Clifford Berry.
