What is creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ways to solve a problem. It can be used in business, creative writing, and more. There are many creative ideas out there that you can use to improve your life or your business. Here are 8 of the most common creative thinking techniques:
1. Problem-solving: When you come up with an idea for a product or service, it’s important to have a clear problem that you can solve. This allows you to think outside the box and come up with a solution that’s novel and unique.

2. Hypothesis: Once you have a problem to solve, it’s important to generate several ideas on how to solve it. By doing this, you get a better understanding of what the problem is, as well as where potential solutions might lead.

Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.
