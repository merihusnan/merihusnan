The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

Ideas are a necessary part of any organization. They can be used to stimulate and motivate employees, to create new ideas for products or services, and to come up with new ways of doing things. Ideas can also be used to assess the progress of an organization and to make changes as needed.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Conclusion
Creative Art: The End of an Era?
For years, creative art has been a staple in society. Whether it’s paintings in a museum or music playing on the radio, art is everywhere. However, with the rise of technology and the changing landscape of the world, is creative art becoming a thing of the past?

With more and more people living their lives online, it’s no surprise that the demand for creative art is declining. With so much content available at our fingertips, it’s easy to see why many people are losing interest in buying paintings or going to concerts. With less demand, there’s also less money going into funding creative projects, which means we could see a decline in quality and quantity of art in the future.

That’s not to say that all hope is lost for creative art.
