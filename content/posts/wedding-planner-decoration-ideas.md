The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

What are some new ideas to consider?
There are many new ideas to consider when it comes to mental health, such as creating a support system for those with mental illness, expanding access to substances that can help reduce symptoms, and developing treatments specifically tailored to the needs of people withmental illness.

1. Create a support system for those with mental illness. There is a wealth of information available online and in books about how to create one, but often people don't have the time or resources to do so.
