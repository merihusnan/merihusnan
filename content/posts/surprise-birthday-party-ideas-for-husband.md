How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

The four C’s of creativity: Creativity, communication, commitment, and control.
Creativity, communication, commitment, and control are the four Cs of creativity. Creative people are able to share their ideas and concepts with others in a way that is effective and connects with them. They also have a strong commitment to their work, which often drives them to continue working even when they feel overwhelmed or stressed.
