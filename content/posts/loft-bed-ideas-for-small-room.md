How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!

Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?

What is the best way to organize your home?
There are many ways to organize a home, but one of the most popular and simple methods is to create a system where each room has its own individual category. This can help you focus on your career or other important responsibilities while still having plenty of space to relax and use your home as you please. Here are five tips on how to make this system work for you: 1) Create categories for bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, family areas, and other areas in your home. This will help you easier find what you need when it comes time to move or rearrange things. 2) Label each category with a relevant keyword or phrase. For example, if you have bedroom categories that include beds, walls, and chests of drawers, then they would be labeled Bedrooms, Walls, Drawers etc.
