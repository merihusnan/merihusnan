Regardless of how you come up with them, the process is the same: you need to be able to brainstorm, generate fresh ideas, and test them out. This is where creativity comes in – it can help you get your original ideas off the ground and into action.

How creativity manifests in different people: Inventors are the most creative, while artists are more creative when they have a personal connection to their work
Creativity is not only evident in inventors, but also in artists. When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it. This has been shown by many studies that show creativity flourishes when people have close relationships with others. For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. 
However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.

Creative art is often characterized by its unique style and approach to depicting or capturing the beauty of life. This often includes using a different medium for each painting or sculpture, or incorporating nontraditional elements into traditional pieces. In order to be considered a true artist, one must have a strong sense of their own creativity and be able to express themselves through their work.
