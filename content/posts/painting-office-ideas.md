How Do You Plan to Make Money from Your Blog: What do you expect to generate revenue from your blog?
Some people expect to generate income from their blogs through advertising, selling products or services, or charging for content. Others may produce content solely for the pleasure of others and hope to make a small profit by selling the resulting e-books, mp3s, or other products. If you have a blog and are interested in generating revenue from it, here are five ideas to get started: 
1. Write about topics that are popular on your blog and generate interest from readers. This could be anything from cooking tips to travel advice.
2. Offer paid subscriptions to your blog so that readers can gain access to fresh content every week without having to wait long periods of time for an update.
3. Make use of social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to actively promote your blog and collect feedback from readers about what they find helpful and interesting on your site.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
