Benefits of invention: How does an idea create value for someone?
Inventions can create value for their creators in many ways, from making a profit to improving the quality of life. But what happens when an invention is created by someone who has no idea what it will do?

But even if the inventor doesn't have any idea what their invention will do, they still have a right to reap the benefits of their hard work. And there are plenty of those benefits - plenty of people are willing to pay money for products that are created using ideas and innovations.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.
