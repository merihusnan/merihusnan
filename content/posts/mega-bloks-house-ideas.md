What is the definition of innovation?
The definition of innovation has been debated for years and there is no definitive answer. In general, innovation refers to a new approach to something or a new way of doing something. Innovations have the potential to change the way people live and work, and can even improve the quality of life for those who use them. However, there are some key elements that must be satisfied in order for an innovation to be considered successful: it needs to be novel, it needs to be affordable, it needs to be accessible, it needs to be viable, and it needs to be safe.

Brainstroming can be described as being in a "zombie zone." This state can be caused by a variety of reasons such as stress, boredom, or fatigue. When the mind is focused on just one thing, it is difficult to move on from that focus.

Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.
