what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.

Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.
