The Problem: What do we need to do to solve the problem?
In today's society, people are constantly looking for ways to get ahead. Some people try to use their intelligence and skills while others look for shortcuts. However, there is no simple answer that will get everyone where they want to go. There are a variety of solutions that must be taken into account in order to solve the problem. One solution is making sure that everyone has access to education. Another solution is finding new and innovative ways to improve the economy.
