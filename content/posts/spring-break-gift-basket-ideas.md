How to be creative: Tips and tricks.
1. Be open to new and different ideas. One way to become more creative is to expose yourself to new and different ideas. This can be done by reading, attending lectures or workshops, and talking with people who think differently than you do.
2. Take time to daydream. Another way to increase your creativity is to take some time each day to let your mind wander. This can be done by journaling, taking walks in nature, or simply sitting quietly and letting your thoughts come and go as they please.

Creative Ideas For You: What do you have in mind that you haven't thought of before?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with creative ideas. First, think about what you want your idea to accomplish. Sometimes all it takes is a little creativity and inspiration to come up with something new and exciting. Second, make sure that your idea is feasible. If your idea doesn't have a lot of money or time put into it, it might not be worth your while to pursue it. Finally, make sure that your idea is funny or entertaining enough before you even think about pursuing it. These three points will help make any creative ideas more likely to become reality.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
