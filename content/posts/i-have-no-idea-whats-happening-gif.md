What is the problem?
It has been suggested that the problem is that people are not interested in Ideas. This has led to a lack of innovation and an increase in traditional methods. There are many ways to try and solve the problem, but none of them seem to be working. There are several possible solutions, but they all have their own set of challenges. One potential solution is to invest in ideas more, but this can be difficult to do given the current climate. Another potential solution is to change how we think about Ideas, but this can also be difficult given the way our culture talks about ideas. A final possible solution is to invest in creativity, but this can also be expensive and time-consuming.
