2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion? What challenges does 2020 bring for the two countries? And is there anything in common between them that could help make their relationship stronger?
One area where China and the United States do have some similarities is their commitment to innovation. Beijing has long championed creativity as a way to improve society, and US President Donald Trump has also made innovation one of his priorities.

Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.
