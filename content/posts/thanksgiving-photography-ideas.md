When it comes to developing ideas, the key is to start with a good foundation and then build upon it. Here are some tips on how to take a good idea and make it great:
1. Do your research. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the topic or issue you're trying to address. This will help you create a more well-rounded and thought-out solution.
