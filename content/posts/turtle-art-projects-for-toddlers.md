What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of improving or creating something new. Innovation can be found in everything from small ideas to big projects. Innovation can help businesses succeed and create new customer relationships. But how do you go about finding innovative ideas? Here are four tips:
1. Take a Look at what Others are Doing: When looking for innovative ideas, it’s important to take a look at what others are doing. This will help you get inspiration for your own project and also gain a better understanding of the industry you’re in.

2. Use Your own Brainpower: The second step is to use your own brainpower. This means coming up with idea after idea until you find one that’s really different from what anyone else has done before.

Origins of Invention: What inspired people to invent?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before. Sometimes Invention comes about because of observing others in their environment and noticing how they solve problems.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service, or concept that is different from the traditional ones. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one way is to say that it is a change in approach or approach to something. Innovation can also refer to changes in the way products are produced, used, or marketed. In some cases, innovation may just mean changing the way something is done instead of creating a new product.
