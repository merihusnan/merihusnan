Uses for inventions: What can you do with an invention?
Inventions offer a new way to do something, make a product or change the way we live. They can be helpful in many ways, from improving safety to solving problems we face every day. Sometimes an invention can be used for its own sake - like a new phone case that protects your phone - but other times an inventor might create an invention for a company or organization, hoping to improve their product or service. Here are some examples of how inventions have been used in the past: 
-An inventor created the first airbag system that saved lives on a highway in 1937.
-An inventor developed the global positioning system (GPS) in the 1990s so drivers could find their way around without having to look at Maps.
-Inventionists have created numerous devices and appliances since the turn of the century, such as solar chargers and anxiety pills.

What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses. One company, called Cortex, sells an app called Brainstorm that helps you focus on specific problems and ideas to improve your problem solving skills. Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. There is no single answer to how or when brainstroming should be used in business, but there are some key principles to follow if you want to try it out for yourself.
