Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started:

3. Get help: There are plenty of resources available online and in books that can help you brainstorm and come up with new ideas.
