Definition of creativity: How is it different from ordinary art?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new and original ideas. It can be defined in different ways, but in general it refers to a state of mind or approach to problem-solving that is unique and often inspires others. Creative art is usually created by artists, who use their own creativity and imagination to come up with new concepts, designs, or ideas.

Conclusion
After studyingfor several years, I think that thepractice of brainstroming is a very effective way to improve your thinking skills. Brainstroming is a term that refers to the process of focusing your attention on a specific topic andJamming all of your other thoughts and ideas right into that one area. After doing this for a while, you will be able to see different perspectives more clearly and be able to come up with better solutions to problems.
