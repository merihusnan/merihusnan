Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.

Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?
