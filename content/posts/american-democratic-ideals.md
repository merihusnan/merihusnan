Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
