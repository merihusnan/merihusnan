Trends in Technology: How will technology impact the future?
As the world moves forward, technology is likely to play an increasingly important role. Here are some ideas for what technology may mean for the future:
1. Robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to grow in importance. This will allow machines to do tasks that once required human beings, such as manufacturing and farming.

2. Virtual Reality could become more prevalent in society. This would allow people to experience different aspects of the world in a completely different way than they ever have before. It could also be used for training military and other professional roles.

3. The internet of things will continue to gain popularity. This means that devices will be able to connect with each other in order to provide services or content without either person having to leave their home.

4. New forms of energy may become popular, such as cryptocurrency and renewables like solar and wind power.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
