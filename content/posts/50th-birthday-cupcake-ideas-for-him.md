The challenges of innovation and its impact on business.
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of business. It allows firms to create new products and services that can be sold and generate new revenue. However, innovation can be challenging and has a strong impact on businesses. There are several challenges that companies face when trying to adopt innovative practices: 1) Lack of understanding of how innovation works – Many businesses are not sure what it takes to implement an innovation strategy and how it affects their business. 2) Implementation failures – When taking steps to adopt innovative practices, many firms end up implementing them incorrectly or without enough detail. This can lead to failed efforts, wasted resources and expensive lawsuits. 3) The negative effect of innovations – Some innovations have a significant positive impact on businesses such as increased efficiency or lowered costs. However, some innovations have a harmful impact, such as creating dependence on foreign manufacturers or exacerbating social disparities.

Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.
