The Creative process: How do you go about creating creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a necessary part of any business. They can help businesses achieve their goals and increase profits. However, creating creative ideas isn't just easy; it takes time and effort. Here are four tips to help you go about creating creative ideas:
1. Take your time

One of the most important things to remember when creating creative ideas is that they should take a while to produce. This means that you should be patient in your pursuit of them. If you're not careful, your ideas may not come to fruition.

2. Be open to feedback

Another important thing to keep in mind when trying to create creative ideas is that there will always be someone who can offer valuable feedback. This means that you shouldn't shy away from seeking out advice or input from those who know more about your industry or product than you do.

A recent study found that people who are brainstroming are more creative and innovative than those who are not.

This allows them to be more creative in their thinking process and generate new ideas.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
