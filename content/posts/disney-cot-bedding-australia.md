What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of change that can create new opportunities and businesses. They are often inspired by a specific problem or situation and can be wide-ranging, ambitious, and futuristic. By definition, big ideas are something new and different - they could be anything from developing a new product to creating a new way of doing business. However, no matter what their size or location, any big idea is capable of blurring the lines between reality and imagination.

The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.
