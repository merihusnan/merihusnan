Definition of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of creative expression?
Creativity has been defined in many ways over time, but there is one common thread that runs through all of them: creativity is a process. In order to be creative, you have to be open to change and new ideas. This opens up the door for all sorts of possibilities, from the simple to the complex.
To put it another way, creativity is not just thinking outside the box; it's also feeling out new ideas and coming up with new ways to express yourself. It can be hard to maintain this level of energy for long, but with a little bit of effort and dedication, you can make your creativeexpression thrive.
