Small ideas can be very powerful, but when they're spread out thinly they're vulnerable to being killed by other ideas. That's where big ideas come in. By coming up with a large, overarching idea, you can fill in the gaps between the small ideas and create a more coherent plan. Big ideas are often more interesting, innovative, and exciting than smaller ones and can help your business take off.

Innovation can also be found in the way that companies operate. For example, Google's approach to searchining was not just different than other search engines, but it was also innovative in the way that it was implemented.

Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.

The power of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is a state of mind, it's ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. People who are creative often have an idea for something that they don't know how to do but they get stuck on how to make it a reality. One reason creativity is so important is because without creativity, there would be no innovation in the world. It can be difficult to be creative at times, but with practice you can become one of the most creative people around.
