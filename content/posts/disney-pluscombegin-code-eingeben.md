Creative expression: How can creativity be used to your advantage?
Creativity is an important tool for any business. It can be used to create unique products or services, or to come up with new ideas for marketing campaigns. However, creativity can also be used in a negative way. For example, some businesses use creativity to make their products look bad instead of selling them at a high price. Other businesses use creativity to come up with innovative ways to compete with other companies. However, all of these examples are important aspects of business and should not be taken lightly.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.

Negative aspects of innovation: What are some potential dangers
When it comes to innovation, there are a few potential dangers that often come with it. Some of these potential dangers could have a negative effect on businesses, consumers and even the innovation industry itself. Here are four examples:
1. Lacking enough sober consideration can lead to reckless Innovation.
2. False assumptions can be created automatically and without much thought, leading to more risky and potentially harmful innovations.
3. Unsafe and impractical products may be born from passionate experimentation and creative thinking, but they could also lead to serious problems down the road if not Icarus-ed away right away. 
4. New ideas can sometimes become what we call " dragons ." These creatures are often able to take over our brains and control our destiny – but only if we let them.
