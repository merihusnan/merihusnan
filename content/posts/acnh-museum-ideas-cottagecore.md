Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
