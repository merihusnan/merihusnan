How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

what is creative art?
Creative art is a form of expression that utilizes one or more creative mediums to convey feelings, thoughts, or ideas. The world of creative art is vast and ever-changing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of human endeavor.
There are countless forms of creative art, each with its own unique purpose and audience. Whether it’s a painting hung in a gallery or a performance piece staged in front of an audience, creative art has the power to provoke emotion and inspire thought.

At its core, creative art is about communication. It’s a way for artists to share their vision with the world, and for audiences to connect with the artist on a deeper level. Whether you’re creating art or simply enjoying it, remember that it has the ability to touch us all in ways that words alone can never hope to achieve.
