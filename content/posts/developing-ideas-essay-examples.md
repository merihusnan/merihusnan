Conclusion: Some ways to overcome the challenges associated with implementing big ideas.
Introduction
Big ideas are always a challenge, but they can be overcome with the right planning and execution. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Take the time to do your research: big ideas often come with a lot of unknowns and potential challenges. Start by doing some basic research on the topic before coming up with any ideas. This will help you understand what challenges you might face and how best to tackle them.

2. Be prepared to fight for your ideas: big ideas often require a lot of work and effort, even if it's just starting out. Don't be afraid to put in the extra elbow grease – it'll definitely pay off in the end!

Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.
