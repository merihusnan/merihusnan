Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency.
