What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points
If you're stuck in a rut and need some invention ideas, look no further. This article will give you a few key points to consider when brainstorming your next big idea.
When coming up with invention ideas, it's important to think outside the box. Consider what needs are not being met by current products and services. Also, don't be afraid to take risks – the best inventions are often those that are unexpected and innovative.

Finally, remember that the most successful inventions are typically those that solve a problem or make someone's life easier in some way. With this in mind, think about ways you can improve existing products or come up with something entirely new that meets a need that isn't currently being met.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but its meaning can be difficult to define. When asked to define innovation, most people will give a general and vague answer. The true definition of innovation is much more specific.
Innovation can be defined as the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a reality. It is the implementation of a new or improved solution that solves a problem or meets a need. Innovation involves creativity, but it also requires resourcefulness, planning, and execution.

There are many different types of innovation, but all share one common goal: to make something better. Whether it’s a new product, process, or service, innovation strives to improve upon what already exists. Sometimes this means coming up with an entirely new solution, and other times it means making small improvements to existing solutions.
