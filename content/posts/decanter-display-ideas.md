Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

What is creativity?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas, concepts or solutions to problems. It can be defined in many ways, but often it refers to the ability to come up with something new and original. Creative people are often thought of as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ideas, but that’s not all that creativity involves. In fact, creativity can also refer to the ability to approach problem solving in a different way or the ability to come up with innovative ways of tackling old problems.
So what exactly is creativity? It’s an adjective that can describe a wide range of things, but many experts believe that creativity is key to success both professionally and personally. There are several components to creativity: time management, planning and focus.

Conclusion: What advice would you give to someone interested in the future of technology?
There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today: 
-Virtual Reality: This could be used for training or for real-world applications such as medical surgery. It's already being used in games and allows users to feel as if they are within the game or the application itself. 

-Augmented Reality: This allows users to see what they're looking at with more detail than ever before. Augmented Reality can also be used for marketing purposes, since it can give people an idea of what products they might want to buy.
