Why big ideas?
In business, big ideas are important to succeed. They can help businesses capitalize on new opportunities and strategies, or give them a leg up in the competition. Here are four reasons why big ideas can be so beneficial: 
1) Big ideas can inspire creativity and innovation. When you have a great idea that others can see as something new and interesting, it can lead to more creative thinking and better ideas overall. 
2) They can be easier to execute than smaller projects. When you have a well-thought-out plan with specific goals in mind, it’s much easier to get things moving quickly and get your project completed on time. This means that your organization won’t have to waste timeWaiting for someone else to come up with an innovative solution or taking too long to develop a plan that’s actually achievable.
