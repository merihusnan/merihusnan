The Benefits of Innovation: Why are innovations successful? What are some common benefits?
Innovation is a process of exploring, testing and improving upon ideas. It has the potential to improve entire industries while making people's lives more comfortable and efficient. There are many benefits to innovation, including increased productivity, reduced costs, diverse product offerings and improved customer service.
