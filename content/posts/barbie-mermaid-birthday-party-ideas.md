Types of creativity: There are three main types of creativity: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
Creative art is a type of art that is created by combining different types of creativity. These include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic creativity. Visual creativity comes from seeing something new in an existing image or object. Audio creativity comes from hearing something new and then creating your own version of it. Kinesthetic creativity comes from feeling something or feeling something in your body.
