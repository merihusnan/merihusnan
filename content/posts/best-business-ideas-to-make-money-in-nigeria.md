Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

Benefits of innovation:
Innovation has many benefits for businesses, including resulting in new products and services, improved efficiency, and increased profits. It can also create new markets, attract new customers, and increase the bottom line. Innovation is key to any company's success, so it's important to consider all of its potential benefits when making decisions about how to apply it. Here are a few examples:
1. New products or services: A product that is innovative can be more successful than one that is not because it is new and different, but because it is well-designed and uses high-quality materials.

2. Improved efficiency: When a business adopts an innovative approach to manufacturing or marketing its products, it can save time and money. This can lead to increased profits for the business.

Business: What is the significance of invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new or change in a product or service. Inventions can be either small or large, and they can come from anyone in the business world. Some of the most famous inventions include the Telephone, the Computer, and the Television. There are many different reasons why an invention might be important, and each invention has its own importance. For example, a Telephone might not have been possible without ideas from John Lennon, and a Computer might not have been possible without help from Intel. 
There are also many different types of inventions that could be made, such as Medical Devices, Toys for Kids, and Food Processing Systems. The significance of any one invention depends on how it can be used by businesses to improve their operations or make their products more marketable.
