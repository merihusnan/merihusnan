What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.

The four types of ideas: brainstorming, problem solving, creative writing, andPeak performance
Ideas can be thought of as a blank slate, which is why they are so powerful. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems, or to write creative works. However, Ideas should not be taken for granted- they can often be very challenging to achieve peak performance. Here are four tips for brainstorming and problem solving:
1. Be open to new ideas. Don't get too wrapped up in your own ideas and don't resist the urge to offer feedback. This will help you to develop better ideas and find better ways to solve problems.

2. Be realistic about what you're asking of your idea generation process. Don't try and create an idea that's too impossible or out of reach- let your creativity take over and see where it leads you!

3. Take time for reflection before starting the brainstorming process.
