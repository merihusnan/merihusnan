Big ideas are what inspire change. They're the seeds that can grow into something new, something better. Sometimes all it takes is a good idea to sparking off an idea that turns into a movement. That's what happened with the women's rights movement. There was no one big idea behind it, but many smaller ones that helped lead to larger changes.
