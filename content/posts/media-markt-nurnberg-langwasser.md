What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.

One of the best ways to improve creativity is to get outside of your comfort zone. When you start thinking outside the box, you can sometimes come up with new and better ideas than you would have thought possible. Creative juices flow when you are constantly exploring new possibilities, and that’s what will help you stay inspired in your work and be more creative overall.
