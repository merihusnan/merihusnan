Invention is the ability to create something from nothing. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing things. Invention is a process that starts with a solution and continues with the development of the product or service. In order for an invention to be successful, it must meet three main conditions: it must be novel, it must be useful, and it must be affordable.

Conclusion: What are some successful inventions?
Inventions are often the products of individuals who come up with an idea for a new product or service, and then go on to make it a reality. Some famous inventions include the transistor, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and the iPhone. The list goes on and on, but it is important to think about what made some of these inventions successful – from the innovative design to the marketing that helped them sell out. Here are six examples of successful inventions that you may have never heard of:
1. The television set: George Martin invented Television in 1928 and introduced it into homes across Great Britain in 1930. The TV set has become one of the most popular devices in history, with over 150 million units sold worldwide.

2. Laser pointer: Sheldon Whitehead developed Laser pointers in 1958 and they became very popular among students and other members of the public.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. Invention has been around for centuries, and it is not limited to just technology. Inventions can be found in all industries, including medicine, retail, and food. There are many different types of inventions, and they can be broken down into five main categories: mechanical objects (such as watches), chemical substances (such as pesticides), transportation systems (such as railways), machines (such as cars and planes), and devices (such as calculators).
