The Possible: What is the best way to come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anything. Some ideas include brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, and tinkering with the idea until it's something you're proud of. However, there are a few things that are always helpful in coming up with new creative ideas. These things could be anything from new business models to coming up with new ideas for products or services. So, what are some of the best ways to come up with creative ideas? Here are four tips: 
1) Get inspiration from others: When you're thinking of new creative ideas, it's important to get inspiration from other people. Not only will this give you a lot of useful input, but it can also help you develop your own ideas more effectively. 
2) Be open to change: Don't be afraid to experiment when it comes time to come up with new creative ideas.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
