How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

Creativity is not a rare talent; it is a skill that can be learned and developed. Just as we exercise our bodies to stay physically fit, we need to exercise our minds to stay mentally fit. A creative person is not necessarily someone who paints or writes poetry; creativity is a way of looking at the world with fresh eyes and seeing possibilities where others see only problems.
