The process: How to go from idea to finished product
Creative ideas are something that can be created from any source. There are a few different ways to go from idea to finished product, but the most common way is through brainstorming. By brainstorming, you can come up with as many different ideas as possible and see which ones seem to be the best. Once you have a few good ideas, it's time to start developing them into a plan. This process is called design thinking, and it's important to remember that the final product should be unique to you.

How to have big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. But, having big ideas is essential for innovation and progress. Here are a few ways to have big ideas:
1) Be curious and ask lots of questions. When you're curious about something, you're more likely to come up with new and interesting ideas about it. So, ask lots of questions and explore the things that interest you.

2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.
