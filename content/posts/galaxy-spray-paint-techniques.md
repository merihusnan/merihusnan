Conclusion: Creative Thinking Tips for You
Creative thinking can help you come up with unique and innovative ideas. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Keep your ideas open-ended – don’t have everything mapped out in your head before you start brainstorming. Be flexible and allow yourself to change and evolve your ideas as you think of more.

2. If you want to be really successful at creative thinking, keep things simple and achievable. Try not to overthink things or try to come up with too many solutions at once – just focus on the problem at hand and see where it leads.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no limit to what you can achieve when you take risks and try new methods.

Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.
