What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.

Business models: How do inventors develop their ideas?
Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.
