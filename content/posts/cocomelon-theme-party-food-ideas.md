Patents are a form of intellectual property that allows an inventor to protect their ideas for products or services with a certain number of years after they come up with them. There are many benefits to patents, including helping to protect the inventor's intellectual property, increasing the chance that their idea will be developed into a successful product or service, and increasing the potential for royalties and other financial compensation that may be available to the inventor.
