Definition of invention: What is the definition of invention?
Invention is a new or improved product, service, process, or device that rises above the common wisdom. It is a creative event in which somebody comes up with a solution to a problem they had previously considered impossible.
Inventions are made up of many different things, such as ideas, technology, and business acumen. They can be small or large, but they all have to meet one key criteria: they must improve upon the existing product or service.
