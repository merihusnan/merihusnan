2) What are your goals? Are you looking to grow or remain profitable? 
3) How can you reach your target market? Do you have a website or marketing strategy in place? 
4) How will your products and services meet the needs of your target market? Will you create a unique selling proposition or copy that stands out from the competition?

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?
