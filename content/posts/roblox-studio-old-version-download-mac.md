How to be creative: Tips and tricks.
1. Be open to new and different ideas. One way to become more creative is to expose yourself to new and different ideas. This can be done by reading, attending lectures or workshops, and talking with people who think differently than you do.
2. Take time to daydream. Another way to increase your creativity is to take some time each day to let your mind wander. This can be done by journaling, taking walks in nature, or simply sitting quietly and letting your thoughts come and go as they please.

3. Be persistent and don’t give up. It’s important to remember that not all of your ideas will be good ones, but don’t let that stop you from being creative. If you keep at it, eventually you will come up with something great!
