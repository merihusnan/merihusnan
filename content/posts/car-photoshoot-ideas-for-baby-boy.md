Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
While it may be a cliché to say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box, Crandall's definition actually provides a more accurate definition for what makes creative individuals successful. By understanding how creativity works, businesses can better define their own goals and strategies for becoming more creative.

Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.

The role of innovation in the economy: How do businesses use it?
Innovation is a key ingredient in the success of businesses. It allows businesses to continuously improve their products and services, which leads to increased profits and better customer service. However, innovation can also be a cost-effective way for businesses to increase their chances of success. For example, Google was founded on the idea that search engines could be improved so that people would find more information faster. By continually improving its search engine, Google became one of the most successful businesses in history. Likewise, Apple was once considered a startup company with little chance of success because its products were not innovative. But because it invested in research and development, Apple was able to create some of the most popular devices in history such as the iPhone and iPad. Innovation is essential to business success and can play a major role in helping companies reach new heights.
