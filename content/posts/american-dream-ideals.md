The election of Sanders signals a new era for progressive politics, as he ran on a platform of Wall Street reform and fighting for the middle class.

The evaluation of creativity: There is no right or wrong way to evaluate creativity. However, there are certain things that are important to consider when judging whether an artwork is creative.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It is important to note that creativity does not have to be applied in a creative way. It can also be used in mundane tasks, like writing a paper or completing an online quiz. However, creativity is often thought of as a quality that comes from the imagination and free thought. A lack of creativity can lead to problems, such as when an individual cannot come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. In some cases, creativity can even be seen as a bad thing, as it can stop people from achieving their goals.
