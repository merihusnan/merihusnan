The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.
