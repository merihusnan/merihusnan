What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning.

While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
