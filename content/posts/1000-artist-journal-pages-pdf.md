How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can help businesses cut costs and increase productivity, but there are a few considerations that businesses should make before implementing innovation. First, innovation can be risky - if it doesn't work out, it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run. Finally, it's important to remember that innovation often requires time and effort - if you don't take the necessary steps to implement it properly, you could see marginal results for a longer period of time.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
