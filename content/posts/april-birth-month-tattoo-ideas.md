The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!
