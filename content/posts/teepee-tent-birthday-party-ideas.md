Creativity is an important concept in our lives. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to find solutions to problems. Here are five big ideas of creativity: 1. One can be creative when they are thinking out loud – this means that they are not just focusing on one thing. They are brainstorming and working on multiple ideas simultaneously. This is an excellent way to get inspired and come up with new ideas. 2. One can be creative when they are working alone – this means that they have complete freedom and control over their work space.
