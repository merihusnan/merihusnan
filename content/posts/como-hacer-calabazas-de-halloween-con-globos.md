Choose the Right Flooring: When you buy new flooring, it's important to choose a style
Flooring is one of the most important pieces of furniture in a home. It can change the atmosphere and feel of a room, and it can also be used as a place to store things or do work. Whether you're buying new flooring or renovating an old one, it's important to choose the right style for your home. Here are four tips to help make this decision: 
1. Consider what you need and want in your flooring: A modern flooring style will likely have wood veneers on top that are colored in different tones, such as green, blue, or purple. If you want something more traditional, choose tile or porcelain over wood because they last longer and are easier to clean. 

2. Choose a color that goes well with your decor: One popular color for new flooring is black or dark brown.

Forms of inspiration: What are some ways to get inspired when you’re working on a project?
Creativity is key when it comes to any project. There are many ways that you can get inspired, and some are more effective than others. Here are a few examples: 
1. Take a walk in the park: This can be an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. Depending on what type of park you choose, there may be different types of attractions to inspire you. For example, if you’re at the zoo, take a walk around the cages or go see the animals in their natural habitat. 
2. Draw something: This can be done in many ways, but often times there’s something specific that will come to mind when you start drawing or painting. Sometimes all you need is a piece of paper and some pen or pencils!
