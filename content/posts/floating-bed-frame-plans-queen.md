What are some invention ideas?
Inventions have been around since the beginning of civilization. From the wheel to mobile technology, there have been many advancements in our ability to make life easier. Some of the more notable inventions include the microscope and the printing press. Here are some other less well-known but still influential inventions that could change how we live and work:
1) Virtual Reality: VR has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with the world around us. By allowing users to move their bodies in a three-dimensional space, VR could let people explore different parts of the world without leaving their homes.
2) 3D Printing: 3D printing is a technology that allows users to create objects from a design or photograph using a computer printer. This makes it possible for small businesses and individual developers to produce high-quality products quickly and at low cost.

But when it comes to big ideas, there's one key rule that startups must follow: always have more than one. A single idea can be limiting, especially if it's based on an old model or a preconceived notion.

How do you get started with ideas?
Start with a brainstorm. A brainstorm is a process of generating new ideas. It can be used to come up with concepts, products, services, or anything you want to think about. Sometimes you need just a few ideas to get started, and others times you need many different ones to come up with something great. The best way to find out if you need more than one idea is to do some brainstorming yourself.
