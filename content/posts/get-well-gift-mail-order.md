The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity. 
The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldn’t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way. Finally, is objective is where youumberofideasyougeneratedbeforecomingupwiththefinalobjective.

The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.

Tips for improving the appearance of your home
Looking to improve the appearance of your home? Here are a few tips to help!
1. Make use of natural light - All homes benefit from natural light, whether they're for sleeping or working in. In order to create this light, start by using windows and doors that open freely, and then keep your curtains and window treatments open.

2. Be creative - Not all home improvement projects are created equal. If you're looking to spruce up your space with some new decorating ideas, be sure to take into account what's important to you and what you can do with minimal effort. Try focusing on details like draperies or fabrics instead of overly-large changes.

3. Use common sense - When it comes to home decoration, be aware of the pitfalls that can often lead to a less-than-appealing final product.
