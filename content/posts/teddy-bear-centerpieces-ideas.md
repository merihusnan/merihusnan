Innovation in science and technology: How do we get there?
Innovation is a process of making something new and better. It can come from technology, science, or anything else that can be improved. There are many ways to make things better, and innovation depends on the right approach.
There are two primary ways to improve innovation: through early detection and correction of problems, and by developing new approaches to old problems. Early detection and correction is essential for ensuring that innovative ideas aren't just abandoned, but brought to market quickly so people can use them effectively.

Developing new approaches to old problems is another important way to improve innovation. This allows for more efficient use of resources, which in turn helps spur growth in businesses and create new jobs. It's important to find the right way to tackle old problems so they can be solved efficiently.
