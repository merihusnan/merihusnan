Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.
