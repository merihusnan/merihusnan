How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!

Patents are a form of intellectual property that allows an inventor to protect their ideas for products or services with a certain number of years after they come up with them. There are many benefits to patents, including helping to protect the inventor's intellectual property, increasing the chance that their idea will be developed into a successful product or service, and increasing the potential for royalties and other financial compensation that may be available to the inventor. There are also some challenges to patents, including ensuring that the invention is actually protected by a patent and that it is not copied or used without consent from the inventor.
