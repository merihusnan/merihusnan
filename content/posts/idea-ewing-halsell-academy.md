Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.

Results: How does your new DIY project turn out?
In the world of DIY projects, there are a lot of different ways to go about them. Whether you're just starting out or have some experience, here are three tips to help make your DIY project turn out successfully:
1. Make sure you understand what you're doing before beginning. If you don't know what you're working with, it's more difficult to do a good job and be efficient.

2. Follow the directions as closely as possible. If there are any changes that need to be made, make them and keep track of where they're located so that you can easily refer to them when things start going wrong.

3. Be patient and organized. That's especially important if you want your project to last longer than expected.
