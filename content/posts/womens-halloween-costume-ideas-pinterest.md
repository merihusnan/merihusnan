Types of creativity:Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, emotional, and intellectual
Creative art is a wide range of forms that can be seen, heard, felt, or even experienced. Some people might consider creative art to be any type of art that is put together in a way that is new and different from the norm. Others might only consider creative art to be visual art, which consists of designs, paintings, sculptures, or photos. Kinesthetic art is also considered to be creative, as it includes the ability to feel or sense something through touch. Emotional art can be considered to be either positive or negative, but all artists have some form of emotional expression within their works. Intellectual creativity refers to any form of creativity that comes from thinking outside the box and coming up with new ideas.

While it is not clear why brainstroming occurs, the study found that it was associated with increased creativity and problem solving skills.
