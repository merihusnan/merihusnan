Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach?

Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future?
