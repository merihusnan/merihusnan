Invention stories are a common occurrence in history. Many inventions were born from the intersection of two or more different ideas and concepts. One invention might be a new way to do something, while another might be a more efficient way to do something. 
One example of an invention that was created from multiple ideas is the computer. Originally, computers were thought to be simple devices that could only do basic tasks like read and write. However, over time, various advancements were made to the computer and it became much more complex. This led to the creation of different types of computers today, which are used in almost every aspect of our lives.
