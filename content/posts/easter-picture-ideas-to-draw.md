Benefits and challenges of innovation
Innovation is a dynamic process that can have both positive and negative consequences. Some of the benefits of innovation include increased productivity, reduced costs, and new products and services that are more efficient or effective.

These challenges can originate from the novelty of the invention itself, from the implementation of the invention into a business environment, or from the interactions between employees and customers who may be using the invention.
