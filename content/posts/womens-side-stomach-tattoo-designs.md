Creative Approaches to Ideas: 1. Brainstorming: Start by brainstorming all the possible ways that your idea could be developed. What are some ideas for stories, designs, products, or services?

Hypothesis: Now that you've explored what you like and don't like about your idea, it's time to come up with an introspective hypothesis about why people might want to use your product or service.
