The best ways to be creative
There is no one answer for how to be creative. However, some ways to become more creative include: practicing brainstorming, keeping a journal, and taking on new challenges.
One way to become more creative is to practice brainstorming. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate new ideas. To brainstorm, you can start by asking yourself questions about a topic or problem you are trying to solve. Once you have generated some ideas, you can then evaluate them and choose the best solution.

Another way to become more creative is to keep a journal. A journal can help you track your thoughts and ideas over time. You can also use it to explore new topics and problems. By writing down your thoughts, you can better understand your own thought process and come up with new ideas more easily.

Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.
