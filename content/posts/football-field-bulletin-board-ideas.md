The power of creativity: What does creativity have to do with success?
Creativity is a key component of success. The ability to come up with new and innovative ideas is what allows people to achieve great things. By definition, creativity is the ability to conceive or come up with new ideas. It can be used for good or bad, but it’s always important in business and life.There are a few things that creativity has to do in order for it to be successful. First, creativity needs to be focused on the task at hand. If it isn’t focused, it will likely go off track. Second, creativity needs to be outlet. This means that it needs a way to get rid of any negative energy or thoughts that are preventing it from working well. Finally, creativity also needs time and effort – both in the form of practice and time itself. Without these three elements, creativity will most likely not result in great success.
