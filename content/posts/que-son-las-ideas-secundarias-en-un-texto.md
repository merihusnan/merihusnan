Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.

Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.
