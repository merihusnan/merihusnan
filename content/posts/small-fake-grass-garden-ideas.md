Creativity in the arts: What makes a piece of art creative?
Creativity in the arts can be defined in a variety of ways, but one definition that is most often used is that creativity involves deviation from the norm. In art, this deviation can come from simply rearranging or adapting pieces of material, to using new voices or ideas to create something new and/or different. Whether it’s a creative idea for a painting or a piece of music, deviations from the norm are what make art creative.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.
