The relationship between creativity and art: How does it work?
Creativity is often considered to be a two-way street. It can either be used to come up with ideas for new products or services, or it can be put into action to create beautiful artwork. art is not just about making things look pretty – it is also about stirring up emotions and conjuring up feelings in people. And that’s why the relationship between creativity and art is so important.
There are a few key factors that contribute to the creativity-art relationship. First, both artists and listeners need some form of stimulation in order to feel inspired. This could be anything from listening to music while brainstorming new ideas, or watching a movie while thinking out loud. Second, artists need some form of feedback in order to continue developing their skills and techniques. The more compliments an artist gets, the better they will become at their craft.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
