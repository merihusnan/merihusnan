1. A new way of thinking about math could lead to more innovative ways of solving problems. 
2. Improving communication could lead to better cooperative relationships. 
3. Reducing food waste could create more sustainable communities. 
4. Developing new transportation systems could save lives and money. 
5. Thinking outside the box can lead to new solutions for common problems.
