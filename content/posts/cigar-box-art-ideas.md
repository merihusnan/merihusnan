The Power of Big Ideas
The power of big ideas is at the root of most innovation. Ideas that are large enough to engage people and make a difference can touch every aspect of our lives. From the simplest things to the biggest challenges, big ideas can impact everything and everyone around them.
There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that you’re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it. Another way is to read articles, watch videos, or listen to lectures on different topics in order to develop an idea for your business or product.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing – no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.

The Future of Healthcare: How will we keep our citizens healthy?
As we work to look into the future of healthcare, we must consider many different ideas. One idea that we could consider is having a system where citizens can access health care on-demand. This would mean that patients and doctors would be able to talk with one another directly, and would not have to go through a bureaucracy. Another idea is having healthcare vouchers which could be used to pay for medical services out of pocket. This would help ensure that people are able to get the best care possible while staying healthy. Other ideas include increasing access to mental health services, ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, and creating more affordable healthcare options. All of these ideas are important in order to keep our citizens healthy and safe.
