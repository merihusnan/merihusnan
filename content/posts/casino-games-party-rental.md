How to do brainstroming in your business: What are some tips?
Are you struggling to keep up with the ever-growing pace of business? If so, brainstroming may be the perfect solution for you. Brainstroming is a technique used in business that helps you stay focused and organized. Here are some tips on how to do it in your own business: 
1. Set goals and targets.

When you start brainstroming, it’s important to have specific goals and targets that you want to achieve. By setting these goals, you can ensure that your brainstroming efforts are directed towards achieving these rather than just talking about it without actually doing anything. 

2. Find a way to track progress.

One of the best ways to track progress during brainstroming is by using a goal tracker such as Goalilla or MorningStar.

The benefits of creative ideas.
Creative ideas can have a variety of benefits – from helping people find solutions to problems to boosting creativity. Here are four examples:
1. Creative ideas can help people solve problems. For example, a creative idea could be coming up with a new way to store food, such as using an airtight container or freezing food in order to make it last longer.

2. Creative ideas can also help people feel more Productive. When someone has a great idea for a product, they tend to be more inspired and motivated to produce the product themselves. This is especially true if the product is new and innovative – something that almost all products have at some point in their development cycle!

3. Finally, creative ideas can boost creativity overall.
