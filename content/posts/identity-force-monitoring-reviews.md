The benefits of creativity
Creativity has been linked with improved mental health, better educational outcomes and even enhanced workplace performance.
A recent study found that people who engage in creative activities are more likely to report higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction.

 creativity can also lead to better educational outcomes. A study of 3,000 primary school children in the UK found that those who took part in creative activities had higher grades than those who didn’t.

And it’s not just students who benefit from being more creative – employees do too. A study of 1,500 workers found that those who had high levels of creativity were more engaged with their work and had lower levels of absenteeism.

Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas. Big ideas are solutions that are large enough to be accomplished, but small enough that they can be implemented. There are many ways to come up with big ideas, so it is important to find the one that works best for you. Some ways to find big ideas include: 
1) thinking out loud – When you have a lot of ideas racing through your head, it can be helpful to take a break and talk about some of them with someone else. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and avoid getting lost in your thoughts. 
2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.

The Future of Work: What will defining trends look like in the future?
In the near future, work will become more dispersed and flexible. This new trend will lead to a lack of employee-led organizations and a rise in the number of independent contractors. As a result, companies will have to find other ways to provide benefits and employees with regular paychecks. In addition, technology will play an important role in this shift as it will allow for more flexibility in work hours and tasks.

The Basics: How do you choose the right tools and materials for a DIY project?
When starting a DIY project, the first step is to decide what you want to do. This can be broken down into five categories: tools, materials, method, tools and techniques, and time. Now that you have an idea of what you need and want, it's time to choose the right tools and materials for your project.
Tools
Choose the right tool for the job. There are many different types of tools available which can be used for a variety of tasks. Make sure you have a good understanding of what each tool is used for before beginning your project. For example, if you are building a box shaped like an S, then a saw would be the best tool to use because it is able to cut through wood very easily.
