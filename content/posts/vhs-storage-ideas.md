Idea 3: How do we use ideas?
Ideas can be put to use in many ways, but one of the most common is turning them into action plans. Whether you're looking to start a business, improve your fitness routine, or just think of new ways to spend your free time, ideas are a great way to get started. Here are three simple tips on how to use ideas to create ACTION plans:
1. Look at what other people have done and come up with ideas for things that you could do yourself too.
2. Take some time for yourself and come up with 10-15 different ideas for things you could do in your spare time. Once you've narrowed it down, take a look at Action Items and see what devices or activities work best for each one.

How creativity can help us: Creativity can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans.
Creativity has been said to be one of the most important skills a person can have. It can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, or plans. While creativity is often seen as a positive attribute, not everyone is naturally creative. However, there are ways to improve creativity and become more inventive. Here are eight tips for becoming more creative: 
1. Be open to new ideas. The more open you are to new ideas, the more likely you are to come up with them. If you're resistant to change or don't like trying new things, it will be difficult for you to be creative.

2. Give yourself time and space to think creatively. When you're stuck on a problem or have an idea for something new, give yourself some time away from distractions so that your brain can work freely.
