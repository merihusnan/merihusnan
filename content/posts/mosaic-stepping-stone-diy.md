Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.
