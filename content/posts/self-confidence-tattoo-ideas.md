Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the key to success in any field. By exploring and applying big ideas, you can realize your full potential and achieve great things. Here are a few tips on how to create big ideas that will help you throughout your career:
1. Make sure your ideas are realistic – don’t overthink things or hype them up too much. If your idea is unrealistic, it won’t be taken seriously and you’ll end up wasting time and energy on something that won’t pan out.

2. Be patient – take your time in developing your big idea and make sure it isn’t just a one-time project. As you develop it, make sure to keep track of the results so that you can measure how well it was received by the audience.
