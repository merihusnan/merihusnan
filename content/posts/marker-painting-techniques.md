In a time where there are ever-changing ideas and technologies, it is important for businesses to have an idea for their product or service that they can market and sell. Some new ideas are born out of necessity, such as in the case of a product that needs to be small enough to carry without being cumbersome, but too large or expensive to create a viable business model around. Other ideas may come from looking at what others are doing and seeing how they could be improved.

What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.
