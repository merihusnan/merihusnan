Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and forms - they can be things we never even thought of, or something that was sitting at the back of our mind but we just couldn't seem to get started on.
Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.

What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to pursue. Here are some key tips to help you come up with the best ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. What is your target market? What are your ultimate goals? When it comes to big ideas, these questions will help you determine which ones are the most feasible and actionable.

2. Take a step back and assess the feasibility of your idea. This includes figuring out how much work it will take to make your idea a reality, how much money youâ€™ll need to create a prototype or develop an MVP, and whether or not you have the right team in place to execute on your vision.

3. Get more input from others before finalizing your idea.
