Summary: What are some tips for staying creative in the workplace?
Creativity is key to staying creative in the workplace. There are a few pieces of advice that can help you be more productive and innovative. Here are some tips:
1. Find ways to get out of your comfort zone. When you’re stuck in a rut, try going against the grain and trying something new. This will force you to think outside the box and come up with ideas that may not have been considered before.

2. Be open to feedback. If you’re not sure what someone thinks of your work, give them some feedback and see how they react. It can help you determine if your ideas need refinement or if they work well on their own.

3. Take time for yourself breaks.

Conclusion: How can creativity help you achieve success and stay creative?
Creativity can help you achieve success and stay creative. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. When you have something to explore, creativity will flow freely. So find something that interests you and start writing or drawing inspiration from it. 
2. Connect with others like yourself. There is no secret to success if you want it - reach out to people who share your same interests and passions in order to get their ideas flowing. If all else fails, talking about your ideas with a friend or family member can be very helpful in inspiring new thoughts and ideas. 
3. Take the time to practice often. Practice makes perfect - so practice what you love most, no matter how difficult it may be to do so regularly (and don't forget- sometimes practice makes perfect).
