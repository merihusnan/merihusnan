Creative tools: What are they?
Creative tools, or tools that can help you be creative, are anything from a tool to help you brainstorm ideas to software that can help with creating art or designs. Here are 8 of the most common creative tools:
1. A spiral notebook – A spiral notebook is perfect for colorful and innovative ideas, as well as for taking sketches and ideas to paper. You’ll love using a spiral notebook as your creative tool because it makes it easy to jot down ideas and keep track of what you’ve been working on. Plus, Spiral notebooks are great for organized creativity because they come in different sizes and widths.

2. A whiteboard – A whiteboard is another great way to get started in your creative process. Just like spiral notebooks, whiteboards come in different shapes and sizes so you can find one that fits your needs perfectly.
