Concluding thoughts on big ideas.
In recent years, big ideas have come to the forefront of many people's minds. Some of these innovative concepts are new and exciting, while others are more general in nature but still important in terms of advancing humanity. In this article, we will take a look at two key ideas that have received a lot of attention in recent years- artificial intelligence and digital citizenship. 
Artificial intelligence is one big idea that has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Many experts believe that this technology can be used to create intelligent machines that can do a majority of the work for us- from cleaning and grocery shopping to driving and making decisions on things like politics and industry. If this technology does become reality, it would be huge news, as it would mean that we could no longer rely on humans to make most decisions for the world.

Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.
