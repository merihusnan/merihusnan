Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.
