The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

The future of work: What will be the biggest changes in work in 2022?
Work in the future will be much more flexible and customizable. More work could be done remotely and on devices that are always with us. This would make work more enjoyable and less physical. There will also be a shift to contract work, where people are hired for a specific duration of time, rather than being employed for the indefinite period of time.
