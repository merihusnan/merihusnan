Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?
