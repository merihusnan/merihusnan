Invention is a process of coming up with a new design, product or service that is different from those currently in use. It can have a number of benefits for businesses, including increasing efficiency and saving time. For example, the discovery of a new vaccine could lead to saved lives and reduced TB cases.

How to write good content
Contentwriting isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing, ongoing process that you can use to improve the quality of your website and increase viewership for your content. Below are some tips on how to write good content and increase viewership for your website or blog: 
1) Start with a strong opener. Your opening sentence should introduce the reader to your topic and help them understand what you're about. 

2) Use verbs correctly. Each verb needs a specific action to complete the sentence, so make sure all verbs are used correctly in your opening paragraph. For example, "I eat," "I play," "I watch." 

3) Use clear language. Your language should be easy to understand and use on a daily basis. Avoid overusing words or adjectives in your writing; they'll sound automated instead of interesting or engaging.
