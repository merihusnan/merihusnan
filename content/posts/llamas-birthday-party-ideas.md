How can we make our ideas into actual products or services?
In business, big ideas are the life blood of startups. They can turn into successful products or services with a bit of effort and creativity. But how do you make your big ideas into reality? Here are three tips:
1) Get help from a marketer: A good marketer can help you identify potential customers and convert them into paying customers.

2) Take your time: Start with small, achievable goals first and then move on to more ambitious ones as you get closer to your target market.

3) Be creative: Be open to new ideas and don't be afraid to experiment. If you can come up with an effective way to solve a problem or reach a new audience, your idea will be more likely to succeed than if you try something that's already been done before.
