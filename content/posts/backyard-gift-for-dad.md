The finished product: What does it look like and how does it work?

But if you're looking for tips on how to build your own watch, there's still a lot you don't know.  So, in this article, we'll take a look at how to make a simple wristwatch using only materials you likely have at home. 
So first off, all you need is some leather or plastic wrap and some screws. You'll also need an electric drill and some wood screws. Next, take the leather or plastic wrap and cut it into 1" pieces.

What To Do When You Have an Idea: What to do with it?
There are a few things you can do when you have an idea for something to do. The first is to make sure that it's something that you're interested in, and second is to see if there's anyone who can help you with it. If you don't have any help from others, or if someone you know is already working on something similar, the third step is to come up with a plan of how you'll go about doing it. The fourth step is to make sure that your idea is something that people will want to do. If your idea isn't something people are excited about, they might not be willing to invest time and energy into it. The fifth step is to find someone who can helpyou execute your idea. This could be someone who has experience in the field, or someone who can helpyou come up with more specific ideas.
