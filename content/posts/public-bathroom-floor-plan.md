Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.

Future of work: What will be the biggest change in the future?
One of the most important changes in the future is likely to be the growing acceptance of artificial intelligence. As machines become better at completing tasks, many jobs that once were done by human beings will be taken over by machines. This has the potential to create a massive workforce shift, with many jobs that are currently considered low-skill or manual labor becoming high-skill or computer-assisted tasks. One way to avoid this is to keep up with the latest advancements in AI technology and develop policies that ensure that every job is filled by someone who can do it well.
