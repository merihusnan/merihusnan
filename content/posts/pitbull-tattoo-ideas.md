Conclusion: The value of big thinking
In a world that is constantly changing, it is more important than ever to be able to think big. Big ideas are what drive progress and innovation. They are the engine of the global economy.
The ability to think big is not something that everyone is born with. It is a skill that must be learned and developed. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most effective is to read widely and to expose yourself to new and different ideas.

Don't be afraid to dream big. The biggest ideas often start out as nothing more than a pipe dream. But if you have the courage to pursue them, they can change the world.
